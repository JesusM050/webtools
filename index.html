    <p> Hi my name is Jesus Mendoza. I'm studying software development. I enjoy coding and working towards learning Angular. Outside of school I'm really into fitness and soccer. The gym has been a big part of my life, and I also follow teams like Barcelona. I'm looking forward to learning and collaborating with all of you this semester.</p>
