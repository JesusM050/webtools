            <p>
                Hi, my name is <strong>Jesus Mendoza</strong>. I'm studying software development and enjoy coding,
                especially learning Angular. Outside of school, I'm really into <em>fitness and soccer</em>. The
                <strong>gym</strong> has been a big part of my life, and I follow teams like <em>Barcelona</em>.I chose
                software development becuase I've always been curious of how things works behind the scenes and the idea
                of building something from scratch and watching it come to life intrigues me.
                I'm looking forward to learning and collaborating with all of you this semester.

            <h2>My Identity</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a future web developer who likes to spend time diving into Angular — particularly Angular reactive
                forms. I'm working to master <cite>modular architecture</cite>. I enjoy breaking down complex pieces
                into more readable parts and using analogies to deepen understanding.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of my proudest moments was building my own <strong>Angular To-Do list</strong> using localStorage
                and Bootstrap.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of my long-term goals is to build a fitness tracking app that combines my love for health and
                technology. I want to create something that's  accessible and actually helps people stay
                motivated in their fitness journey.

            <h2>My Learning Journey</h2>
            <p>
                I started getting into web development in high school. It was challenging, but I found it fascinating to
                create my own page. In this class, I look forward to sharpening my HTML and CSS skills. I also want to
                explore more modern semantic practices while building web applications. Styling has always been a
                weakness for me, so I hope this class helps me improve that area I've been neglecting.
